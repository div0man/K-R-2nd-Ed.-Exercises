Ah Love! could you and I with Fate conspire   Ah Love! could you and I with Fate conspire
To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,  To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,
Would not we shatter it to bits -- and then   Would not we shatter it to bits -- and then
Re-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire!     Re-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire!
